### Requirements Specification for Mobile Mine Simulator

### 1. Introduction

The Mobile Mine Simulator is a software application designed to model the behavior of mobile mines and simulate the interaction between mines and ships attempting to navigate through a minefield. The simulator will follow a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and employ object-based programming to optimize the behavior and performance of mobile mines. This document outlines the requirements for the simulator.

### 2. Simulation Environment

- **Multiple Runs**: The simulator should be capable of conducting multiple runs.
- **Stopping Conditions**: The simulation shall have defined stopping conditions, such as a maximum number of steps or a specific event occurrence.

### 3. Inputs

- **Initial Conditions**:
  - Ability to input initial conditions via:
    - Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    - Saved previous inputs

### 4. Outputs

- **Realtime Representation**:
  - Graphic video representation of the simulation in real-time.
  - Realtime score display for each run, showing the performance of ships and mines.
  - Status indicators for ships and the minefield.
- **Final Outputs**:
  - Final score display for each run upon completion.
  - Ability to output a video file of the simulation.
  - Ability to output results of multiple runs to a file for analysis.

### 5. Minefield Configuration

- **Mine Layout**:
  - Ability to vary the layout of mines within the simulation environment.
- **Mine Behavior**:
  - Ability to modify the behavior of mines (e.g., movement patterns, activation triggers).
- **Mine Damage Range**:
  - Ability to adjust the damage range of mines.
- **Number of Mines**:
  - Ability to vary the number of mines in the simulation.
- **Mine Characteristics**:
  - Ability to input mine characteristics from a file.

#### 6. Fleet Configuration

- **Starting and Ending Locations**:
  - Ability to set and vary the starting and ending locations for the fleet of ships.
- **Fleet Behavior**:
  - Ability to modify the behavior of the fleet (e.g., evasive maneuvers, formation patterns).
- **Number of Ships**:
  - Ability to vary the number of ships in the fleet.
- **Ship Characteristics**:
  - Ability to input ship characteristics from a file.

#### 7. Statistics and Reporting

- **Transit Success Rate**:
  - Percentage of ships that successfully transit through the minefield.
- **Ships Killed**:
  - Number of ships destroyed by mines.
- **Ships Survived**:
  - Number of ships that survived the transit.
- **Mine Statistics**:
  - Percentage of mines remaining after each run.
  - Number of mines destroyed.
  - Number of mines that survived each run.

#### 8. Software Architecture

#### 8.1 Model-View-Controller (MVC) Design

- **Model**:
  - Represents the data and the behavior of mines and ships.
  - Manages the state of the simulation.
- **View**:
  - Provides real-time graphical representation of the simulation.
  - Displays statistics and scores during and after the simulation.
- **Controller**:
  - Handles user inputs and interactions.
  - Updates the model based on user commands and simulation events.

#### 8.2 Object-Based Programming

- Use object-oriented principles to create classes for:
  - Mines (with properties for behavior, damage range, etc.).
  - Ships (with properties for behavior, starting/ending locations, etc.).
  - Simulation environment (with properties for minefield layout, fleet configuration, etc.).

### 9. User Interface

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - Intuitive interface for setting initial conditions, starting/stopping the simulation, and viewing results.
  - Input fields for configuring mines and fleet characteristics.
  - Real-time display of the simulation environment and status indicators.

### 10. System Requirements

- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Minimum: Standard desktop computer with a modern CPU, 8GB RAM, and integrated graphics.
  - Recommended: High-performance computer with a dedicated GPU, 16GB RAM, and high-resolution display.

- **Software Requirements**:
  - Operating System: Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux.
  - Development Environment: MatLab (with libraries for GUI development and real-time graphics).
  - Additional Libraries: Depending on the chosen language, necessary libraries may include Pygame, Matplotlib, or similar for Python; or Three.js, D3.js, or similar for JavaScript.

#### 11. Development and Testing

- **Development**:
  - Follow agile development practices with iterative cycles and continuous feedback.
- **Testing**:
  - Unit testing for individual components (mines, ships, simulation environment).
  - Integration testing for overall system functionality.
  - User acceptance testing to ensure the simulator meets user needs and requirements.

This specification outlines the key requirements and design principles for the Mobile Mine Simulator. The development team should use this document as a reference to ensure all necessary features and functionalities are implemented effectively.
